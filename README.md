frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game
===============================

## My Contributions
Though this project did come with a bit of starting code to get its users going. I developed multiple classes from the ground up and created collision for the assets that the project provided for me. Utilized properties and methods to have multiple object interact with each other.

### What I learned
This project is the first time that I used *classes* with *object oriented programming*. Now when it comes to everything I see in the real world. I turn things into objects.

#### Plans for future changes  
Here are some ideas that I have on making this project better in the future
  1. Create a game class that would create all other objects.
  2. Organize my constant variables in to one file *do a better job organizing my different js files.*
  3. Name my classes better i.e:
  `const player = new Character(characterSelect);`
  4. My modal looks bad I would like to fix that also have a character select screen.
  5. Not sure how `get()` and `set()` work but I think that they could really do some goo if I implement them.
  6. *CSS* Animation would be awesome!!!

## Instructions
Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.
